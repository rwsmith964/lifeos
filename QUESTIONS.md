# QUESTIONS.md

Questions that genuinely cannot be decided without Richard's input, per Section 1.4. Sorted by priority (HIGH, then MEDIUM, then LOW) within each pass. Deduplicated.

## Build Brief Queue (QUEUE-###)

Entries below use the format mandated by the "Build Brief — Competitive Parity + Moat Extension"
(§7): sequential `QUEUE-###` numbering, never reused, logged instead of stopping to ask. The
pre-existing `Q-XXX` sections below (from the prior autonomous engagement) are untouched — this is
a new section, not a reformat of the old one. `Blocking: Yes` entries get a matching
`TODO(QUEUE-###)` marker in code.

### QUEUE-001
**Module:** Phase 0 / process
**File(s):** `QUESTIONS.md`, `FEATURES.md`
**Question:** The repo already has a `QUESTIONS.md` using a `Q-XXX` format (Q-001–Q-006, three
still open) from a prior autonomous engagement. The new build brief mandates a different
`QUEUE-###` format. Overwrite the old file, or reconcile?
**Assumption made:** Append a new `## Build Brief Queue (QUEUE-###)` section to the existing file
rather than overwriting it — the old Q-XXX entries are still live, unresolved product questions
for Richard and must not be lost. New entries from this engagement use `QUEUE-###` exclusively.
**Reversal cost:** Low
**Blocking:** No

### QUEUE-002
**Module:** Module 1 / Relationship & Gift Engine
**File(s):** `app/(app)/people/[id]/`, `lib/db/repositories/relationship-gift-engine.ts`
**Question:** Module 1's backend (6 new tables + gift pipeline stages, all flagged off) is done,
tested, and merged, but no person-detail-page UI surfaces any of it yet (profile details,
wishlist, relationships, conversation log, moments, reciprocity ledger). Build the UI now before
moving to Module 2, or keep going module-by-module on backends first and build UI for everything
in a later pass?
**Assumption made:** Keep moving — build Module 2's backend next per the brief's "never idle"
mandate, since backend-first with the flag OFF is fully compliant with the additive contract
(zero effect on the live app either way). UI for Module 1 (and any other module built
backend-first) is tracked as a follow-up in BUILD-REPORT.md rather than blocking progress through
the remaining modules.
**Reversal cost:** Low
**Blocking:** No

### QUEUE-003
**Module:** Module 2 / Leisure Planner
**File(s):** `app/(app)/activities/leisure-planner-actions.ts`, `lib/planner/score-breakdown-display.ts`, `lib/planner/gear-checklist.ts`
**Question:** Same shape as QUEUE-002 — Module 2's backend (3 new tables + `opportunities.score_breakdown`, all flagged off) is done, tested, and merged, but no UI surfaces the viability config manager, gear checklist manager, outing log form, or opportunities breakdown display yet.
**Assumption made:** Keep moving to Module 3 per the brief's "never idle" mandate — backend-first with the flag OFF is fully compliant with the additive contract. UI for Module 2 (alongside Module 1's) is tracked as a follow-up in BUILD-REPORT.md rather than blocking progress.
**Reversal cost:** Low
**Blocking:** No

### QUEUE-004
**Module:** Module 2 / Leisure Planner
**File(s):** `lib/opportunities/detect.ts`, `lib/planner/score-breakdown-display.ts`
**Question:** `detect.ts` is an orchestration function (forecast fetch + day-scan loop + DB writes) with zero existing test coverage; the brief calls for characterization tests before touching code like this, but a true characterization test would require mocking the weather/forecast provider and the full day-scan loop, a much larger undertaking than the actual change (adding a `score_breakdown` argument to two existing `create()` calls).
**Assumption made:** Extract the flag-gated decision of what to persist into a separately-defined, fully unit-tested pure function (`resolveOpportunityScoreBreakdown()`), and edit `detect.ts` only to call it — the minimal-diff edit to the orchestrator is a one-line-per-call-site substitution, and the actual decision logic being tested is exactly the same regardless of which function contains it. Treated as a pragmatic substitute for full characterization tests on `detect.ts` itself, not a substitute for testing the logic at all.
**Reversal cost:** Low
**Blocking:** No

### QUEUE-005
**Module:** Module 2 / Leisure Planner
**File(s):** `lib/planner/generate.ts`
**Question:** The weekend-plan narrative generator (`lib/planner/generate.ts`, an AI-prompt surface) could also show a score breakdown alongside its narrative text, matching what Module 2 now does for `opportunities`.
**Assumption made:** Leave `generate.ts` untouched this pass. It is a higher-risk AI-prompt surface than `detect.ts`, and the brief's "don't refactor working code beyond what's needed" plus "one module per branch, merge only when green" argue against expanding Module 2's scope into a second file with its own testing burden. Deferred to a future pass.
**Reversal cost:** Low
**Blocking:** No

### QUEUE-006
**Module:** Module 2 / Leisure Planner
**File(s):** `lib/planner/generate.ts`, `activity_type_viability_configs`
**Question:** Should the new `activity_type_viability_configs` table actually be wired into the existing `isFishingRelevantLocation` gate in `generate.ts`, so a household's declared viability inputs affect real scoring/gating rather than being a purely declarative, unread table?
**Assumption made:** No — v1 ships `activity_type_viability_configs` as declarative-only (a household can record and later view which inputs matter for an activity type), and the existing gate in `generate.ts` is left completely untouched, per the standing rule not to refactor existing working code. Wiring it into live gating is a larger, separate change with its own risk profile (a misconfigured household could accidentally suppress real opportunities) and is deferred to a future pass, likely alongside QUEUE-005.
**Reversal cost:** Medium
**Blocking:** No

## HIGH

(none open)

## MEDIUM

## Q-004 | shell layout / desktop-tablet | Priority: MEDIUM | Opened 2026-08-30
**Question:** The whole app shell is intentionally a narrow ~448px mobile-width column, centered with large unused margins on tablet/desktop (confirmed by the D-049 audit — zero functional bugs, just an unused-space product question). Should LifeOS ever get a real multi-column desktop layout, or is "phone-shaped app centered on desktop" fine indefinitely? It's a legitimate, common pattern for personal apps used mostly on a phone, so there's no wrong answer here — just needs your call before investing in a desktop-specific layout.

## LOW

## Q-006 | Golf activity / stray location | Priority: LOW | Opened 2026-08-31
**Question:** While building D-095 (multi-location activities), found that the Golf activity already had a second, previously-hidden location row whose name is literally `"Eugene, Oregon"` (likely a leftover from an early geocode-on-save fallback, before there was any UI to see or manage it). It's now visible and editable/removable on the Golf edit page under "Other locations." Want it renamed to an actual course name, or removed? Left as-is since it's your real data, not mine to guess at.

## Q-005 | daily brief / "look-ahead" | Priority: LOW | Opened 2026-08-30
**Question:** An early backlog line mentioned a "look-ahead" for the daily brief, but the detailed wording wasn't recoverable from the repo or session history when this was picked up. What should "look-ahead" mean here — a longer brief event window (e.g. showing the next 3-5 days, not just today/tomorrow), a weekly preview section, or something else? Everything else on that same backlog line (markdown rendering, seeing-them-today suppression, People-link tappability) was concrete enough to build without asking and is done (D-048).

## Resolved

## Q-002 | weekend-planner / odfw | Priority: MEDIUM | Resolved 2026-08-21
**Question:** Do you want a manual override field where you can paste in a fishing report you've read yourself, alongside the ODFW scraper?
**Answer:** No override — scrape-only, exactly as built (Option A). `lib/external/odfw.ts` needs no changes.

## Q-003 | notifications / sms | Priority: MEDIUM | Resolved 2026-08-21
**Question:** Start A2P 10DLC carrier registration now, in parallel, so SMS is ready the moment it's approved?
**Answer:** Skip it for now (Option B). No registration started; `lib/notifications/channels/sms.ts` stays a no-op behind the dispatcher interface, ready to swap in later without touching calling code.

## Q-001 | NAMING | Priority: LOW | Resolved 2026-08-21
**Question:** What should the product actually be called?
**Answer:** Keep "LifeOS" (Option A) for now. `APP_NAME` in `lib/constants.ts` stays as-is.
