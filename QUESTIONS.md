## Q-002 | weekend-planner / odfw | Priority: MEDIUM | Resolved 2026-08-21
**Question:** Do you want a manual override field where you can paste in a fishing report you've read yourself, alongside the ODFW scraper?
**Answer:** No override — scrape-only, exactly as built (Option A). `lib/external/odfw.ts` needs no changes.

## Q-003 | notifications / sms | Priority: MEDIUM | Resolved 2026-08-21
**Question:** Start A2P 10DLC carrier registration now, in parallel, so SMS is ready the moment it's approved?
**Answer:** Skip it for now (Option B). No registration started; `lib/notifications/channels/sms.ts` stays a no-op behind the dispatcher interface, ready to swap in later without touching calling code.

## Q-001 | NAMING | Priority: LOW | Resolved 2026-08-21
**Question:** What should the product actually be called?
**Answer:** Keep "LifeOS" (Option A) for now. `APP_NAME` in `lib/constants.ts` stays as-is.
