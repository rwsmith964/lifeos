# QUESTIONS.md

Questions that genuinely cannot be decided without Richard's input, per Section 1.4. Sorted by priority (HIGH, then MEDIUM, then LOW) within each pass. Deduplicated.

## Build Brief Queue (QUEUE-###)

Entries below use the format mandated by the "Build Brief — Competitive Parity + Moat Extension"
(§7): sequential `QUEUE-###` numbering, never reused, logged instead of stopping to ask. The
pre-existing `Q-XXX` sections below (from the prior autonomous engagement) are untouched — this is
a new section, not a reformat of the old one. `Blocking: Yes` entries get a matching
`TODO(QUEUE-###)` marker in code.

### QUEUE-001
**Module:** Phase 0 / process
**File(s):** `QUESTIONS.md`, `FEATURES.md`
**Question:** The repo already has a `QUESTIONS.md` using a `Q-XXX` format (Q-001–Q-006, three
still open) from a prior autonomous engagement. The new build brief mandates a different
`QUEUE-###` format. Overwrite the old file, or reconcile?
**Assumption made:** Append a new `## Build Brief Queue (QUEUE-###)` section to the existing file
rather than overwriting it — the old Q-XXX entries are still live, unresolved product questions
for Richard and must not be lost. New entries from this engagement use `QUEUE-###` exclusively.
**Reversal cost:** Low
**Blocking:** No

## HIGH

(none open)

## MEDIUM

## Q-004 | shell layout / desktop-tablet | Priority: MEDIUM | Opened 2026-08-30
**Question:** The whole app shell is intentionally a narrow ~448px mobile-width column, centered with large unused margins on tablet/desktop (confirmed by the D-049 audit — zero functional bugs, just an unused-space product question). Should LifeOS ever get a real multi-column desktop layout, or is "phone-shaped app centered on desktop" fine indefinitely? It's a legitimate, common pattern for personal apps used mostly on a phone, so there's no wrong answer here — just needs your call before investing in a desktop-specific layout.

## LOW

## Q-006 | Golf activity / stray location | Priority: LOW | Opened 2026-08-31
**Question:** While building D-095 (multi-location activities), found that the Golf activity already had a second, previously-hidden location row whose name is literally `"Eugene, Oregon"` (likely a leftover from an early geocode-on-save fallback, before there was any UI to see or manage it). It's now visible and editable/removable on the Golf edit page under "Other locations." Want it renamed to an actual course name, or removed? Left as-is since it's your real data, not mine to guess at.

## Q-005 | daily brief / "look-ahead" | Priority: LOW | Opened 2026-08-30
**Question:** An early backlog line mentioned a "look-ahead" for the daily brief, but the detailed wording wasn't recoverable from the repo or session history when this was picked up. What should "look-ahead" mean here — a longer brief event window (e.g. showing the next 3-5 days, not just today/tomorrow), a weekly preview section, or something else? Everything else on that same backlog line (markdown rendering, seeing-them-today suppression, People-link tappability) was concrete enough to build without asking and is done (D-048).

## Resolved

## Q-002 | weekend-planner / odfw | Priority: MEDIUM | Resolved 2026-08-21
**Question:** Do you want a manual override field where you can paste in a fishing report you've read yourself, alongside the ODFW scraper?
**Answer:** No override — scrape-only, exactly as built (Option A). `lib/external/odfw.ts` needs no changes.

## Q-003 | notifications / sms | Priority: MEDIUM | Resolved 2026-08-21
**Question:** Start A2P 10DLC carrier registration now, in parallel, so SMS is ready the moment it's approved?
**Answer:** Skip it for now (Option B). No registration started; `lib/notifications/channels/sms.ts` stays a no-op behind the dispatcher interface, ready to swap in later without touching calling code.

## Q-001 | NAMING | Priority: LOW | Resolved 2026-08-21
**Question:** What should the product actually be called?
**Answer:** Keep "LifeOS" (Option A) for now. `APP_NAME` in `lib/constants.ts` stays as-is.
